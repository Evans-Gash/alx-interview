# Project 0x01: Lockboxes

This Python algorithmic project, authored by Carrie Ybay, a Software Engineer at Holberton School, focuses on solving the "Lockboxes" problem. The project commenced on January 8, 2024, at 6:00 AM, with a deadline set for January 12, 2024, at 6:00 AM. The checker was released on January 9, 2024, at 6:00 AM, and an auto-review will be conducted at the deadline. The project specifications include using specific editors (vi, vim, emacs), interpreting/compiling on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3, adherence to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x), and ensuring all files are executable. The primary task involves implementing a method, `canUnlockAll`, that determines if all the locked boxes can be opened based on the provided conditions. The README.md file provides essential information and usage examples for the implementation. The project is hosted on GitHub in the repository "alx-interview" under the directory "0x01-lockboxes," and the main Python file is "0-lockboxes.py."

# Lockboxes Problem

## Problem Description

You are faced with a coding challenge known as the "lockboxes problem." The problem involves a series of locked boxes, each numbered sequentially from 0 to n-1. Each box contains keys that may open other boxes, following specific rules:

1. A key with the same number as the box can open that specific box.
2. There may be keys that do not correspond to any boxes.
3. A box may be empty, meaning it does not contain any keys.

The task is to write a function or algorithm that determines whether it is possible to unlock all the boxes, starting from an initially unlocked box.

## Function Prototype

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether all the boxes can be opened based on the provided set of boxes.

    Parameters:
    - boxes: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a box and contains integers representing keys.

    Returns:
    - True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.
    """
